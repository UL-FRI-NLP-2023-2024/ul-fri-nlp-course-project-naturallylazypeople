\paragraph{Prompt Tuning}
% Prompt tuning\cite{lester2021power} is a process where users refine their input prompts to generate more accurate and relevant responses from AI models like GPT-3.5. It involves experimenting with different phrasings, keywords, and structures to guide the model towards desired outputs. By iteratively adjusting prompts, users can fine-tune the model's understanding and improve the quality of its responses for specific tasks or contexts. Prompt tuning is crucial for optimizing AI performance and tailoring its outputs to meet diverse needs effectively.
