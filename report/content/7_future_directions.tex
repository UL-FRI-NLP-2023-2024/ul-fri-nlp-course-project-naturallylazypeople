In the future we want to focus on other PEFT method, \textit{BitFit} and \textit{Prompt Tuning}. 

Other direction of our work will be to broaden selection of benchmarks on which we test the methods.

Lastly, we may do more in depth hyperparameter tuning regarding each model, e.g. with LoRa try different matrix ranks, etc.
