Use the Methods section to describe what you did an how you did it -- in what way did you prepare the data, what algorithms did you use, how did you test various solutions ... Provide all the required details for a reproduction of your work.

Below are \LaTeX examples of some common elements that you will probably need when writing your report (e.g. figures, equations, lists, code examples ...).

\subsection*{Code examples}

You can also insert short code examples. You can specify them manually, or insert a whole file with code. Please avoid inserting long code snippets, advisors will have access to your repositories and can take a look at your code there. If necessary, you can use this technique to insert code (or pseudo code) of short algorithms that are crucial for the understanding of the manuscript.
